# I made another web framework

Yes, there’s something wrong with me and i swear this is the last one.

Not totally satisfied with rails but wanted to get most of the advantages of the ruby ecosystem, I made a “rails lite” (like sqlite) and I named it [radical](https://github.com/swlkr/radical). It’s not really for anyone but it’s there if anyone wants to use it, go right ahead. Some high level features:

- models
- views
- controllers
- no singular/plural requirements
- optional assets/bundling
- default strict csp config
- in fact only resource routes (from rails) are supported
- only supports one level nested routes

I actually really like it, but I don't think I have the time or the energy to sink into another open source ruby web framework. At this point in my life, I need money, not open source donations.
