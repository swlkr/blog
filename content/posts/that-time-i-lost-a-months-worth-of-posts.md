# That Time I Lost A month's Worth of Posts

Remember that one time I decided to start blogging in earnest on my own domain as a static hugo site
but I changed computers and didn't push the source changes to github so I lost a month's worth of blog posts?

Good times.

It's actually kind of funny because I wrote this whole 6 part series on cloning
twitter but it wasn't really that good, I kind of phoned home for most of it, I don't
have to worry about it anymore though, because that's that. I deleted the first four parts
because I'll never recover the final two so there it is.

The good news is that I think this is the final push for me to really invest in a personal
blog that runs on top of sqlite and has automatic daily backup via cron to backblaze b2,
similar to what I do with janetdocs.

Or it could be a good time to record a video and put it on youtube going through the code
I already wrote for the twitter clone OR it could be a great time to drop everything and give
up trying to make money on the internet with saas software.

I haven't decided yet.

You'll know if my online presence goes dark, actually you won't.
